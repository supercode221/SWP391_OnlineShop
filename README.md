## What we learn

I have never learned such a huge knowledge of web application until I get my hands dirty with this project. Specifically, I get to know how the system works by applying the Agile methodology, from defining the requirements, designing the wireframes to constantly coding and testing what we have done. Finally, everything has a solution as long as we keep brainstorming, staying self-controlled and counting on what we are doing.

Last but not least, the project wouldn't be this complete had it not been for my friends' support and our tremendous teamwork effort. I just feel very lucky to be a part of this team.

As a leader, i feel completely happy to finish this project with mah team.
